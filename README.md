Title: Average Active Sessions: The Magic Metric?

Abstract:

The Oracle 10g RDBMS exposes a conceptual, architectural and user-interface framework for identifying and diagnosing performance problems that uses database time as the core measure of performance impact. The wait-model performance analysis approach now in wide use by experienced DBAs has been formally embedded into Oracle 10g. One key new concept introduced is that of the time-normalized DB time, referred to formally as Average Active Sessions. This presentation will discuss the origin and meaning of Average Active Sessions and its visibility and usage in Oracle 10g, including ASH, AWR, V$ tables, sysmetrics and server alerts, and Enterprise Manager. We will focus on both theoretical and practical aspects of this important metric.
